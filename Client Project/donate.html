        <p> Donations are used to fund our events, to throw fundraisers for the community
            and to find more resources for our exhibits. We are dedicated to giving an affordable place
            for families to take their children (and themselves!). We also host weekly gaming nights and donations
            go towards helping us give more opportunites to those who need a fun place to
            meet people and explore their passions. In the future we are looking to organzie many
            competititve gaming teams.
