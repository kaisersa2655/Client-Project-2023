        <p> The Video Game History Museum is a nonprofit Museum dedicated to bringing people of all ages together over a shared interest in gaming. Video Games have an extensive history and VGHM wants to celebrate and share that with the beloved community. Gamers from all over the country come to visit and meet people who have the same
            passion and interest for gaming. The museum hosts events for new game releases and takes donations to help build their community.</p>
